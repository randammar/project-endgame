The Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) is important to most aspiring law students in the US. Studying for the LSAT Logic Games (Logical Reasoning) part of the exam can be tedious, unless we can make it fun! This project aims to build a place where students can practice simplified logic games and sketching problems. Questions will vary in difficulty and allow for variations in answers to some degree.
